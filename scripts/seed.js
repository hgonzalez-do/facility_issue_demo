 * Fills the dashboard with plausible traffic so you can rehearse, take
 * screenshots, or check the layout without standing in front of 200 people.
 *
 *   node scripts/seed.js --fake     # instant, no agents, deterministic rows
 *   node scripts/seed.js            # fires the real trigger: one microVM each
 *   node scripts/seed.js -n 40      # more, cycling through the canned list
 *
 * Without --fake this is the demo doing its actual job, so it costs sandbox
 * time and takes as long as the agents take. Tickets appear as they land.
